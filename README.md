Creating a - shady - Magic 8 Ball using Python. A simple tool you can operate in your terminal or add to the back-end!

I adapted this from various magic-8 ball codes available online including: 
- https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/magic-8-ball-written-in-python
- https://www.w3resource.com/projects/python/python-projects-5.php

To do: 
- Create a front-end so it's more interactive. Currently a WIP but will upload when I finish it!
